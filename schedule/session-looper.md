Twist and shout with me as I walk through the creation of the ultimate Beatles tribute app, over 50 years after the British Invasion. Using Vue.js to build a native mobile app, you'll learn about the challenges inherent in building this kind of app into a truly multimedia experience. Weâ€™ll discuss building an art project within the app with an interactive album-creator, how to build a soundboard, and how to use machine learning to learn more about the poetry of the Beatles. We'll take a look, finally, on whether we can even improve on the classic songs by running their lyrics through a recurrent neural network. Can generated lyrics be anywhere near as interesting as the original? Let's find out as we bring the 1960s into 2019.
