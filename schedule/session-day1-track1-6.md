It’s 2018 and we’ve achieved the dream: robots that make phone calls for us. Oh, and we can also use JavaScript to build apps for basically any platform. That’s probably the more relevant dream.

And because JavaScript can be used to create apps on virtually any platform, developers have created a variety of projects that let you, wait for it, build for multiple platforms—AT THE SAME TIME. I know, right?

In this talk we’ll focus on NativeScript and React Native, both of which have the ability to build web apps, native iOS apps, and native Android apps, simultaneously. You’ll see some amazing demos of these projects in action, and then learn when using these projects is a good idea, and also when using them is a not-good idea. Come learn about using JavaScript for apps and stuff!
