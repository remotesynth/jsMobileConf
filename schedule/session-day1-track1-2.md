VS Live Share is a free code collaboration service for VS Code. Think of it as Google Docs for your JavaScript files. Multiple developers can collaborate on the same project all within their own editors. This is not source control. This is you loading up someone elseâ€™s entire dev environment on your own machine. Seriously. Come take a look at how Live Share really changes the way that we think about how we work together. You might be shocked to learn what it can do, and how it can dramatically improve your workflow.
