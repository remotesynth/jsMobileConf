short-description: 'We have evolved as humans to navigate a 3D world for millions of years. Yet, in the last 2000 years we are trying to represent our 3D world in 2D instructions. Abstracting 3D information on a 2D space has been the most efficient way to transfer knowledge and served us well. Today we are not limited by the technology anymore. In this talk, we will learn how to use Mixed Reality to create tutorials made for humans.'

Remember a time when you looked at a set of instructions, to assemble a piece of furniture or draw a picture, and a hard time following the instructions? If you did, you are not alone. We all have evolved as humans to navigate a 3D world for millions of years. Yet, in the last 2 thousand years we are trying to represent our 3D world in 2D instructions. Abstracting 3D information on a 2D space has been the most efficient way to transfer knowledge and served us well. Today we are not limited by the technology anymore. We can represent information in the right context and right space. In this talk, we will learn how to use Mixed Reality to create tutorials made for humans.
