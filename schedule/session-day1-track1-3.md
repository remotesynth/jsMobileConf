The Hot Module Replacement (HMR) feature in Webpack can replace bits of code in a program while the program is running. What's more - the program will know that something inside it has changed and can decide how to handle it. For example, it can keep the values of its variables, evaluate the new code and restore the values of the variables. And you don't need to restart the program to see the changes!

That sounds kind of cool, right? But let's put it in a different context.

The HMR feature in Webpack can replace modules in a NativeScript application while the application is running. What's more - the application will know that something inside it has changed and can decide how to handle it. For example, it can keep its state, evaluate the new code and restore the state. And you don't need to restart the application to see the changes!

In this talk, I will explain how HMR works and show you some crazy stuff you can do with it. Just let your imagination run wild!

Oh, did I mention that NativeScript 5.0 comes with support for HMR?
