JavaScript is an openly standardized programming language, but what does that mean and how does that work? And why is it important, anyway? This talk will cover JavaScript's standardization efforts in Ecma TC39 and what it means to create and implement open standards. Weâ€™ll also take a look at the future of web standards, some of the opportunities available for mobile web standards, and how the process is evolving to fit the needs of modern developers.
