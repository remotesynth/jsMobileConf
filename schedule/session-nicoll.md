I believe developers of any caliber and framework could benefit from knowing more about the power we have as developers over usability and how we can use that power for good.

In this talk I will go over some very obvious (and some not so obvious) patterns that are used to manipulate users. Understanding usability gives us a lot of power as web and mobile designers/developers. We should use this knowledge for good, rather than tricking users into un-intended behaviors. This kind of UX trickery breeds distrust in not only your web app, but the web in general. Come learn how to use your powers for good.
