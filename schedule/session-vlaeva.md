V8 is the JavaScript engine powering Google Chrome, Node.js, and NativeScript.

NativeScript embeds V8 to process JavaScript and dynamically call Android APIs. This enables developers to write Android applications in JavaScript and directly access the underlying OS.

In this session, we'll cover various topics based on the experience of the NativeScript team with the V8 engine - from GC synchronization, through implementing a multithreading model, up to practical advice for optimizing start up time.
