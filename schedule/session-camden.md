short-description: 'A deep dive into how browsers enable websites to store data for your users. This will include a look at the options, discussions of when to use what, and a look at libraries to make them easier to use.'

One of the best ways you create a better performing web site is to store often used data on the client. Browsers have provided ways to do this since the beginning of the web but the level of support has improved dramatically over the past few years. In this session I'll cover:

- Cookies (yes, cookies)
- Web Storage
- IndexedDB
- Service Workers and the Cache API

For each I'll describe the basic API, show examples of usage, talk about when you would use each, and share some libraries that make their use simpler.
