Last December CarGuru’s bundle sizes were insane, and the build times were too darn high. I’ll show you how in an 8 week period, we turned the site’s performance around, and how we cut our build times from 20 minutes to 4. I’ll show off a set of plugins we wrote, along with webpack best practices that can really make your very large applications scream.
