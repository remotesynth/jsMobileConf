I have a confession to make: I'm not a gifted writer. I often write terrible docs, poorly organized and filled with explanations that don't even make sense to me when I read them later. Despite this, people often love my docs when they're published - yes, love. I get hugs from strangers for my technical writing! In this talk, I'll walk through my process for turning terrible initial drafts into something hug-worthy.
