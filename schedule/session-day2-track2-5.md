Webpack is cool! It improves your app performance so much that it's virtually impossible not to use it.

But great tools come with great responsibilities...and sometimes cause great problems. But hold on - we're developers and we love challenges! We can resolve every problem if we have the guts to dig into it and the right debugging tools.

Come to this talk to learn how to tackle webpack problems effectively. We will cover the basics of:

- debugging webpack builds;
- debugging ahead-of-time compilation errors;
- debugging snapshot generation errors;
- debugging webpacked applications.

* Important - we won't even use StackOverflow!
