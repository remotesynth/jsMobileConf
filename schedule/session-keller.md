How can we make computers aware of how focused or tired a user is? Using a simple JavaScript library, we can tap into a wealth of information about users to radically change they way we present information to them. Welcome to thought computing, where we’re able to build applications around and for the user. We’ll leverage a wearable computer called Notion that’s able to read a users' brainwaves and convert them into actionable metrics via a simple and easy to use API.
