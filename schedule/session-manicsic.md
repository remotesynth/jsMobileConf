Join me as we give walk through plain English descriptions and joyful anecdotes of these mysterious terms. I aim to help you understand these terms enough to explain them to all the people you know that also pretend to understand them. “Currying? Sounds delicious!” is something you can avoid saying after this session. We’ll also cover some new proposals coming to the JavaScript/Node.js standard so that you’ll be ahead of the game when people start talking about `globalThis` as if they already understand what `this` is. If you’re reading this abstract and have a word you’d like deciphered feel free to tweet me [@tzmanics](https://twitter.com/Tzmanics) (DMs are open too if you have to keep a knowledgeable guise).
