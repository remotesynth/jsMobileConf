Ashi's first program printed `I LOVE YOU MOM` in a colorful infinite loop; she was six at the time, and she was hooked. Her career has found her building projection art for [NOAA](http://noaa.gov), reading your email at Google, and spending three years teaching at coding bootcamps. She recently joined Github as a senior engineer, where she’s working on Atom. She’s been studying machine learning over the past several years with the comingled sense of awe and frustration. One day, she will teach a robot how to love; until then, it’s all about classifying cat photos.
