# Breathe Life into Mobile UX with Solid Architecture Lessons

Let’s dive into successful architecture lessons to building well crafted mobile user experiences. The variety of disciplines including design, in depth platform experience and engineering often contribute to the daunting task of building a mobile app rich in features while maintaining a simplistic beauty and delightful feel to its end users. To make matters more challenging is the demand to the developers to craft a codebase that is scalable, easily maintainable and versatile which could withstand new features for years without affecting performance or stability. It’s easy to code yourself into a corner in large mobile app developments. In this workshop we’re going to look at architectures that can be streamlined by the use of thoughtful schematics and also look at building lively user interfaces which provide versatility with room to scale with tools like NativeScript for iOS and Android.
