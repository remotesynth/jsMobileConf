Burke Holland is a front-end developer living in Nashville, TN; the greatest city in the world. He enjoys JavaScript a lot because it's the only way he Node to Express himself. Get it? Never mind. Burke blogs only slightly better than he codes and definitely not as good as he talks about himself in the third person. Burke works on the Azure team at Microsoft on behalf of JavaScript developers everywhere. You can find him on Twitter as @burkeholland.
