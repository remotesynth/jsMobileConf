I help developers all over the world build amazing things with Particle! Much of my job involves building cool stuff, writing and speaking about the power of Particle’s hardware, firmware and cloud software. I’m a self-taught maker, and I love helping developers new to IoT discover how easy and fun it can be to jump in and build connected products. I also love getting kids and families into electronics, which I do on nights and weekends as the founder of [Carrot Pants Studios](https://store.carrotpantsstudios.com/), a maker education and publishing company.
